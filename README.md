## Git <a name = "git"></a>
Git is a Version Control System(VCS).


## What is VCS? <a name = "what_is_vcs"></a>

VCS is a software tool that helps teams manage changes to source code over time. It keeps track of every modification to the code and if a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimising disruption to all team members.

In simpler words, VCS keeps track of every change in a code base and makes rollback to previous versions easily

## Benefits of VCS <a name = "benefits_of_vcs"></a>
- It makes rolling back to an earlier version very easy
